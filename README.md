### About Sense

Sense is a daemon service framework that automates the inference process for Large Language Models (LLMs) / GenAI models and manages the auto-scaling of resources with an intelligent, adaptive approach. It is designed to dynamically adjust computational resources based on real-time demand and system performance, ensuring optimal efficiency and robust model performance. We believe that managing LLMs/GenAI should be a seamless and efficient process, freeing developers to focus on innovation rather than resource management. Sense simplifies the complexities of scaling and resource optimization, making it an essential tool for any project involving large language models.
