### üî¥ This is an alpha version. Please report any bugs or suggest any improvements.
### üìã Introduction
This repository includes a daemon service designed to automate the inference process for Large Language Models (LLMs) / GenAI models and manage the auto-scaling of resources. The daemon intelligently adjusts computational resources in response to real-time demand and system performance, ensuring high efficiency and robust model performance.

### ‚ú® Features
- **ü§ñ Automated Model Inference:** Streamlines the process of deploying LLMs for inference tasks.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Dynamic Auto-Scaling:** Adjusts resource allocation based on current workload and performance metrics, optimizing for cost and efficiency.
- **üëÄ Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly checks system health and performance, ensuring reliable operation.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling and Failover:** Implements robust error handling and failover mechanisms to maintain continuous service.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Support our Subnet: Assigning weights
As a validator in the Bittensor network, your support is crucial for the success and efficiency of subnets like Flavia. We invite you to consider assigning weights to our subnet, which will significantly contribute to its performance and the overall robustness of the network.

To allocate weights to the Flavia subnet, you can use the ```btcli root weights``` (**SN17**) command.

By assigning weights to our subnet, you play a vital role in enhancing its inference capabilities and overall contribution to the BitTensor network. Your support helps us maintain a high-performance, reliable, and efficient subnet for decentralized model inference.

We appreciate your contribution and thank you for your support in advancing decentralized AI with Flavia.
